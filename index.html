          <h2>NYU Course Registration: Albert</h2>
          <p>ALBERT, NYU's registration system, works seamlessly for its basic function but leaves a lot to be desired when helping students decide what to take or find courses across the many different schools and programs. In this project, we investigated student needs, frustrations, and wants regarding course selection to identify key insights pointing to how we might design better course selection resources and tools.</p>

          <h2>FOLS Final Report: Learning on Reddit</h2>
          <p>Established in 2005, Reddit is a 17-year-old social platform that allows users to discover and share content matching their interests. Stephanie, Shihan and I each selected an observation lens to explore learning behaviors on Reddit. I also made a Wix site to showcase our findings and analysis.</p>
