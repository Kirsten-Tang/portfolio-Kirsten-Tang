This results in a decline in social relationships and interactions, leading to loneliness and other related problems that prevent them from having a healthy retirement life. Unfortunately, current learning solutions are insufficient to address the needs of seniors who are unfamiliar with technology. A learning solution is needed to bridge the digital divide and help our target population to acquire the necessary digital skills to stay connected with the world and reduce social isolation. Our learning design aims to provide an accessible learning platform for seniors, enabling them to learn effectively and overcome social isolation."
