PawfectNYC—a social learning platform designed for young pet owners in NYC—could fill a crucial gap in addressing the needs of the target population because it would provide a structured and supportive online community for learning and sharing information. Such a platform would be a lifeline for NYC young dog owners who are commuters, helping them to balance their busy lives with the needs of their beloved pets."

As the platform develops, some other age groups may also be included. I want to focus on dog owners because they face more severe challenges than owners of other pets in NYC since dogs require regular exercise and socialization. Also, focusing on a specific type of pet allows PawfectNYC to tailor its services and content to the unique needs of dog owners rather than trying to provide a one-size-fits-all solution that may not be as effective for all types of pets."

            "The digital age has left many elderly individuals behind, particularly those 65 and older, leading to social isolation and the inability to connect with younger generations who primarily communicate through social media after retirement. This results in a decline in social relationships and interactions, leading to loneliness and other related problems that prevent them from having a healthy retirement life. Unfortunately, current learning solutions are insufficient to address the needs of seniors who are unfamiliar with technology. A learning solution is needed to bridge the digital divide and help our target population to acquire the necessary digital skills to stay connected with the world and reduce social isolation. Our learning design aims to provide an accessible learning platform for seniors, enabling them to learn effectively and overcome social isolation. \n We divided the stakeholders into three categories, namely direct stakeholders, indirect stakeholders, and mixed stakeholders. We listed all the stakeholders and made a stakeholder map. \n We also conducted 5 interviews with our target population. Our research process involves the identification of a target population of seniors over 65 and preparing interview questions. We also searched the internet for existing learning solutions, the target population's learning habits, teaching methods, curriculum, and learning environment settings. In the second stage, we conducted interviews with six interviewees, collected data, and prioritized the needs of the target population. We also compiled helpful resources from the web, including existing solutions, research articles, and social media tools. Last but not least, we also identified challenges faced by seniors, such as fraud and privacy issues. According to the data we have collected, in our vision, we will set the course in a physical environment; that is, seniors will come to the physical classroom to learn. We have considered in detail both the physical and the social context of our learning environment. \n Our general learning goal is for 65+ seniors to gain more social connections after completing social media courses. The specific goals and objectives for the WeChat, Alipay and Youtube courses are outlined, including tasks such as commenting on a post, sending a message, and subscribing to videos.",
            "In the design phase, We brainstormed many preliminary design ideas, and after integrating all the opinions, we got three relatively complete design ideas. According to these three designs, we finally integrated them into the final design through all aspects of consideration. After the design stage, we made an LMS prototype based on our final design idea. Then we prepared a series of evaluation plans, and based on the collected data, we modified our design. We are utilizing Google Classroom as our Learning Management System (LMS) due to its collaborative features, which allow us to work together as a team simultaneously. This platform is an accessible and user-friendly option with a straightforward interface. We selected a cover image that showcases our three primary courses: WeChat, Alipay, and YouTube. Furthermore, we opted for a green color scheme as it has a calming effect on users and is gentle on the eyes."
